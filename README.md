Iris Flower Classification Project
Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica, based on the given features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

Dataset:
The Iris dataset, which contains 150 observations of iris flowers with the following attributes:

Sepal Length (in cm)
Sepal Width (in cm)
Petal Length (in cm)
Petal Width (in cm)
Species (target variable with three classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica)
Steps Involved:

Data Exploration and Visualization:

Load the dataset and examine its structure.
Perform data cleaning if necessary.
Visualize the data using scatter plots, pair plots, and histograms to understand the relationships between features and the distribution of the species.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values if any.
Encode the target variable (species) into numerical values.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (typically 80-20 or 70-30 split).
Model Selection:

Choose appropriate classification algorithms such as:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Logistic Regression
Train multiple models to compare their performance.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Train the selected models using the training set.
Evaluate the models using the testing set.
Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to assess model performance.
Perform cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the best hyperparameters for the models.
Retrain the models with the optimized hyperparameters.
Model Deployment:

Choose the best-performing model.
Save the model using serialization techniques like pickle or joblib.
Create a simple user interface or API to make predictions on new data.
Conclusion:

Summarize the findings and the model's performance.
Discuss potential improvements and future work.
Tools and Libraries:

Python
Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
